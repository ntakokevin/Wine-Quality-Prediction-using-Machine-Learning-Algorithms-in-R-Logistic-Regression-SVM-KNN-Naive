# Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms in R: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest - A Comparative Analysis

The objective of this project is to predict the quality of wine using various machine learning algorithms implemented in the R programming language. The algorithms considered for this analysis are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.

In this project, the data has not undergone any preprocessing. However, it is important to note that preprocessing the data can potentially improve the model performance.

The project follows the following steps:

## a) Data Split: 
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with 70% of the data used for training.

## b) Model Fitting: 
Using the "India.csv" dataset, with the target variable "anemia2," the selected algorithms are fitted to the data. Logistic Regression (LR), SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes (NB), and Random Forest (RF) models are trained.

## c) Model Evaluation: 
Each model's performance is assessed by computing various evaluation metrics, including Accuracy, Balanced Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-Score, and Precision.

## d) Comparative Analysis: 
A comprehensive table is created to summarize and compare the performance of the different models based on the evaluation metrics calculated in step (c).

## e) Preferred Model Selection: 
A paragraph is dedicated to explaining the preferred model choice, considering the comparative analysis results. The reasoning behind the preferred model is provided, taking into account the performance metrics and any other relevant factors.

By conducting this analysis in R, we aim to develop an effective wine quality prediction model. The comparative analysis allows us to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, enabling the selection of the most suitable model for this specific prediction task.
